# Recurrent-Neural-Network

This project will be used as a base to learn the Tensorflow framework. The final goal is the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network model able to perform some basic sequence-to-sequence task. This project will also be the starting point of a serie of Neural Networks projects for NLP tasks and as such will include "standards" batcher and trainer which will be reused for the following projects.
